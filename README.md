# ConspiraciesQrGame by Anthony BABIN

## Why I choose this game?

Mainly because I love the board game "Complots" (which is the new edition of "Coup") that ConspiracieS is inspired by.
It seemmed to be great for DOM manipulation and JS in general. 
This game has a kind of complex logic with a lot of rules to implement, with some bluff and counter, wich is verry challenging.

## Key features

- Radio Button with hover style and disabled attribute depending on the rules.
- Complex game engine to manage rules and logic.

## What's next?

- Clean my code and avoid DRY.
- Add a log option to see the whole game action history.
- Add some difficulty levels for the computer player.
- Work on design.
- Add animations.
- Add sounds effects.
- Add a liar helper to prevent player for the bluff.
- Detect Enter key instead of clicking on "Next" button
- Add the multilingual option (fr / en).
- Add other characters to the game
- Add player


### About the rules :
Earn (or steal) coins to grow your treasure and kill your opponent's characters.
If your treasure is more than 9 coins, opponent's characters assassination is mandatory and will be automaticly done.
You can use a character's power but pay attention, if you don't have the character in your deck, the opponent could ask to check that you're not a lyer. If you lie, one of your character will be killed, otherwise your card will be changed and your oppenent will loose a card as he doesn't trust you. 
You can also ask to check your opponent's character if he used a character power, but identically, you will â€¦!

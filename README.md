# ConspiraciesQrGame by Anthony BABIN

## Why I choose this game?

Mainly because I love the board game "Complots" (which is the new edition of "Coup") that ConspiracieS is inspired by.
It seemed to be great for DOM manipulation and JS in general.
This game has a kind of complex logic with a lot of rules to implement, with some bluff and counter, which is very challenging.

## Key features

- Radio Button with hover style and disabled attribute depending on the rules.
- Complex game engine to manage rules and logic.

## What's next?

- Clean my code and avoid DRY.
- Add a log option to see the whole game action history.
- Add some difficulty levels for the computer player.
- Work on design.
- Add animations.
- Add sounds effects.
- Add a liar helper to prevent player for the bluff.
- Detect Enter key instead of clicking on "Next" button
- Add the multilingual option (fr / en).
- Add other characters to the game
- Add player

### About the rules:

Earn (or steal) coins to grow your treasure and kill your opponent's characters.
If your treasure is more than 9 coins, opponent's characters assassination is mandatory and will be automatically done.
You can use a character's power but pay attention, if you don't have the character in your deck, the opponent could ask to check that you're not a liar. If you lie, one of your characters will be killed, otherwise your card will be changed, and your opponent will lose a card as he doesn't trust you.
You can also ask to check your opponent's character if he used a character power, but identically, if he has the character needed, you will lose a card otherwise he will lose a card.
Hint for bluff: there is 5 characters and the game deck as twice the characters (so 10 cards in the deck)
